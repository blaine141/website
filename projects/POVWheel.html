        <h1>POV Wheel</h1>
        <h3>February 2017 - March 2017</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A POV Wheel is a
                strand of lights spinning with the colors changing of each led at
                certain positions to create an image. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkFxiqJLKM">This</a>
                is a video of someone else's running.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                I made an agreement with my dad that he would build the wheel spinning
                structure and I would make the electronics. The first thing I knew it
                would need to know is it's current position. After much consideration I
                came to the final solution of a magnet at one moint near the wheel and
                a magnetic sensor on the rim of the wheel. Based on the time between
                pulses, you can determine the speed of the wheel and from that, get the
                position from time since last pulse.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                At my dad's job, they have a bunch of spare circuit boards so I used
                one of those to control the lights on the wheel. It tracked the
                position and talked to the led strip with an SPI bus. The
                microcontroller was a pic 18f4550. We used it because it can run faster
                then the usual microcontroller. One of the big challenges was getting
                the microcontroller to run quickly so that we could spin the wheel
                faster. I had to learn about what was going on at the base level. I
                rediscovered MANY times that 1d arrays are faster than any other type
                of array and to calculate any value that you are going to use more than
                once ONLY once.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                To load new pictures on the wheel I made a wheel in Visual Basic that
                takes an image file and with polar graphing creates arrays in C with
                the color at certain polar coordinates. It then creates a C header file
                with the arrays in it. Just compile with the header file and reprogram
                the wheel. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Here is a picture of the wheel spinning. In the end, It had 6 screens
                and cycled through them. I also used it to ask my girlfriend to
                prom.&nbsp;</p>
