        <h3>August 2014 - September 2015</h3>
            <p>
                 The <a href="http://www.electrimotion.com" target="_blank">Electrimotion</a>
                order
                system is an order system I was asked to make. It needed to allow a customer to order a
                product and supply any other notes about the product. There also needed to be an internal portal 
                to view the orders, update their progress, and supply shipping information. The customer could also 
                view all this information on a status page.</p>
            <p> All the orders and products are
                stored in a MySQL database and accessed through a PHP page. 
                The website is dynamic. The company can update the orders either by using 
                their internal portal or by updating their database</p>
            <p>
                Another cool feature that I made is the UPS Tracking link. At the time, UPS did not have an easy 
                way to open up a tracking number by URL. They required you to fill out a form with POST to view tracking info. 
                Electrimotion still wanted to be able to link to UPS tracking orders, though. My workaround was to have a hidden form with 
                all the same info as the UPS form. When you click the link, it really just submits the form to UPS. The result was effectively 
                a link that will open up your tracking info with UPS</p>
