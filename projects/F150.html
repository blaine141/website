        <h1>The F150</h1>
        <h3>March 2014 - May 2014</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My freshman year in highschool, I joined the
            Olentangy High School Robotics Team. My dad joined as a chaperone and
            we both had a blast that year. He got really involved and we were both
            really disappointed when it ended. The next few days he was telling me
            all about other robot controllers that there are. Soon, he had an idea.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea was to take a <a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/brands/powerwheels/index.html">Power Wheels</a>
            car&nbsp;and make it remote controlled. We got a Gorgon from 221
            Robotic Systems. This is a programmable device with many outputs able
            to recieve inputs through wifi. To control the motors, we got Talon
            speed controllers. They get PWM input and vary the speed of motors
            based off of that input. Then to turn the steering wheel, we needed
            position feedback to know where the steering wheel was positioned. We
            put in a potentiometer and connected it to the steering colums to
            monitor where the wheel was turned. Then, it was simple to program it
            and set up the drive station. Using a simple joystick and a laptop, I
            could make the truck drive and turn.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Also, at one point, I added a model rocket launcher to the truck. We
            then drove it out into the middle of a field and launched a rocket from
            hundreds of feet away at the press of a button. It was pretty cool!</p>
