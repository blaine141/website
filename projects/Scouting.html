        <h1>Robotics Scouting</h1>
        <h3>February 2017 - March 2017</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Last year, Liz
            Halter from Olentangy High school with the help of her dad created an
            interesting scouting system. We never really did any scouting before
            created her system that year. She made a program hosted from a computer
            that other devices would connect to through a wired network. It would
            then make decisions about matches from that data collected. We won an
            award that year for our scouting system. I didn't help her make or
            operate any of it so that is about as much as I know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            This year, 2017, I wanted to follow in her footsteps, so early in the
            year I started developing software. I was in AP Statistics so I decided
            to make it all fancy. I added probability of win calculations and all
            other sorts of features.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            About two weeks later I heard other people saying that they wanted to
            work on scouting. I joined in on the conversation and we started from
            scratch. The original team was me, Ryan Schwartz, Will Main, and the
            adult mentor Patrick Worth. We had a series of meetings where we
            discussed objectives and end goals. It was a pretty good experience to
            be working on a team like that brainstorming. Mr. Worth had worked with
            this web service called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>.
            It allows data structures and... I don't quite know the name. Anyway
            Mr.
            Worth had experience and he shared it with us.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Once we had all the ideas on the board, we started eliminating and
            narrowing down onto what we wanted. We finally came to the solution. We
            would have a web app, a website that you can cache and run as an app. We would then share this app with
            other teams and have them collect data, then share some of our resources with them. Gracious
            professionalism, guys.
            Ryan Schwartz was in charge of the app. How it would work is you record
            auto data, amount of fuel scored, starting position, whether or not a
            gear was scored, whether there is a gear in the not, whether the line
            was crossed, etc. Then, during teleop, you would record when events
            happened in the match. When the bot picked up a gear, you would click
            the gear start button. When it was delivered, you would select stop and
            select whether or not the gear was delivered successfully, effectively
            creating a timeline of the match. Then at the end of the match you can
            record notes and show where the bot usually traveled. The team scout
            recorded all that information. Now in the brainstorming process we
            concluded that It would be near impossible to watch the whole match and
            also keep track of fuel score. So we had another type of scout, the
            fuel scout. They recorded how the fuel score changed for each alliance
            during the match. The app also had features for assigning certain
            people to specific matches. Ryan really put focus on making the app look nice with Google's material design.
            I have to admit, it looks nice, and he even showed me how to incorporate the design in my slideshow. <a target="_blank"
                href="http://olentangyfrc.org/scouting/">This page</a>
            has some info on the app.</p>
        <p align="center"><img style="height: 400px;" alt="" src="Images/ScoutingApp.png"></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I worked on the data storage website and the analytics. As I said
            earlier, the website was made with Drupal. I made data structures and
            Mr. Worth taught me how to make modules using PHP. I made modules to
            take JSON formatted input and create the data structures to represent
            that information. From the website you could view each match and info
            about them. From that point the data was exported through JSON and
            downloaded to be analyzed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            My analysis program was created in Visual Basic. It looked at the
            events recorded and then converted that to useful data as simple as
            average gears per match to the usual amount of time taken to score one
            gear to the accuracy of the shooter. To know how well the shooters
            scored, it matched up each change in the fuel score to a team by
            looking at when each team was shooting. All of this data was then
            compiled down into team and match info. For each match it looked at how
            much time it took for them to score fuel and gears and then calculated
            how many gears and fuel each team should score for a highest alliance
            score. Then, for each team, data was exported into CSV files. One file
            contained general summary information for each team, one contained each
            event from each match for each team, and finally, one contained info on
            where the team usually drives their bot. Another file contained match
            optimization info.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            All of this data meant nothing if you didn't have a way to look at it.
            Liz used Tableau, a data visualization software last year, so we
            decided to go down the same route. We made a sheet for team info and a
            sheet for match info. You just selected which team or match you want
            and it will show you all the data for that team or match. There is too
            much info to list so I will just show you a picture of each.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;Match Dashboard:</p>
        <p align="center"><img style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" alt="" src="Images/ScoutingMatch.png"></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;Team Dashboard:</p>
        <p align="center"><img style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" alt="" src="Images/ScoutingTeam.png"></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Before each match we would just print
            off the match dashboard for each alliance and brief our alliance on
            what we were going to see in the next match.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            One other thing I wanted to make was a slideshow in the pit area that
            will show summaries of scouting data. Some of the slides that were
            included were the top three climbers, shooters, and gear teams. It also
            included a slide for match predictions for upcoming matches and the
            "Dream Alliance". All of this could be easily updated by plugging a
            flash drive in the laptop which triggers it to copy all of the scouting
            info off and update the slideshow. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
        <p align="center"><img style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" alt="" src="Images/ScoutingSlideshow.png"></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I have to say, it was
            quite an experience even though I spent my whole spring break coding.</p>
