        <h1>Thermostat</h1>
        <h3> - December 2016</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My dad asked me to
            make the thermostat in our workshop remote controlled. I had done it in
            the past but we had issues with it. I used a Minilab DAQ board to input
            the temperature and control a relay, so I decided to use the same
            system.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I had a program always running in the background on my computer that
            would read data from a file and if it said to turn the thermostat on,
            it did and then it would update the temperature in the file. I made a
            webpage to control the thermostat. The webpage used PHP to run a
            program I made that would read the temperature from the file and update
            the file with whether the thermostat should be off or on. The PHP page
            would then display the output of the program.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I wanted more experience with programming apps so I decided to make an
            app to control this. I made the app and it used the PHP page to control
            the thermostat and read the temperature. It passed data to the PHP page
            using the GET method. Here is what the app and DAQ board looked like:</p>
