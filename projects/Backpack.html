        <h1>My Backpack</h1>
        <h3>October 2012 - May 2016</h3>
        <p>Throughout my high school
            career, I have been
            adding features to my backpack. It started freshman year when I
            thought it would be cool to have a usb charging port. I took
            a portable battery, put it in a pouch, and mounted a usb port in the 
            headphone hole so that it could be accessed from the outside.</p>
        <p>
            Now that I had this usb port, everyone in school was asking to charge off of me. 
            I needed cables. I started packing my
            backpack with headphones, audio cables, charging cables, and
            communication cables. Whatever people needed I wanted to make sure I had it.</p>
        <p>
            The next step on the upgrade train was speakers. But to power something like that, I needed a bigger battery.
            I found a 12v 8000mAh NiMH battery, grabbed some desktop speakers, and plugged them into each other.
            I wanted the speakers to be bluetooth so I got a
            bluetooth module and hooked that into the system. 
            My backpack was rocking, although I will admit, my bus driver hated me. </p>
        <p> The next big upgrade came when I learned about the Raspberry Pi.
            My dad bought one and asked for me to learn
            how to use it for him. I had used linux before, but only had an elementary understanding.
            Once I got it set up, I connected a portable screen
            and a wireless keyboard to make it portable. Everything conveniently fit inside a pencil case. I used the 
            12v battery to power the monitor and a regulator to power the Pi. 
            About this time I had also made my homework
            webpage. It was an online list of my homework assignments that I could check off. 
            To add assignments to this list, I hooked the Raspberry Pi to the webpage. 
            We were not allowed to use phones in class, but nobody said anything about a 
            wireless keyboard. To enter in the homework assignments, I would use the keyboard to 
            type the assignments into the webpage all while the raspberry pi and monitor were still stored in my backpack. 
            </p>
        <p> After a
            while without many upgrades, I came up with the idea to add an outlet to my backpack.
            It was nice charging my phone but what I really needed was to charge my laptop.
            I found a 12v inverter online and ordered it. I wired it up to my battery and got it working in a few
            days. To show it off I was walking around my house with my backpack on and carrying a
            lamp that it was powering.</p>
        <p> Then came the idea
            that everyone in high school knows me for. I was sitting in psychology,
            junior year, wondering what else I could add to my backpack. I was
            thinking of decorative lights, but I couldn't think of exactly what kind of lights I
            wanted. Then, it hit me; Turn signals! As soon as I got
            home, I got to work researching. My dad provided me a microchip
            PIC18f4685 demo board and introduced me to the programming language C.
            I stopped by my local grocery store and bought trailer lights I zip-tied to the outside of my backpack.
            I had a prototype set up in 3 days and was excited to see the
            looks on everyone's faces. I had connection issues with that demo board
            so I borrowed a circuit board from my dad's work. I made a few modifications to the hardware and reprogrammed
            it. After properly sewing and wiring buttons on the front straps with conductive thread, it was all working.</p>
        <p> Over the
            summer of 2016, I gained more experience with PIC microcontrollers and
            the language of C while working for Electrimotion. Electrimotion
            produces a device that contains a PIC microcontroller, a screen, keypad, and
            many inputs and outputs. I immediately wanted to use it for my
            backpack. I took the device, reviewed some schematics, and modified it to be my
            new backpack controller. With this new screen and keypad, I was
            capable of changing settings about the turn signals and controlling power
            to various systems. I was also able to read voltage, temperature, current, and total power draw in mAh.
            I also implemented over-current and over-temperature protection along with a hidden game.</p>
        <p>
            I have since removed the turn signals due to a damaged battery, but I still try 
            to keep my backpack interesting. I always carry with me a multimeter, screwdriver, 1TB hard drive, dice, cards, 2 laptops, a swiss army knife, and a flashlight.</p>
