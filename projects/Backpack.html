        <h1>My Backpack</h1>
        <h3>October 2012 - May 2016</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All throughout my high school
            career, I have been
            adding features to my backpack. It all started freshman year when I
            thought it would be cool to have a usb port on my backpack. My mom had
            a simple portable battery and I came up with the idea to put that
            battery in my backpack and mount a usb port in the headphone hole in my
            backpack. It only went on from there.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Now that I had this usb port, I needed cables. I started packing my
            backpack with headphones, audio cables, charging cables, and
            communication cables. Along with extra batteries. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Next, I added speakers to my backpack. My dad supplied me with a 12v
            8000mAh NiMH battery and I just grabbed the set of desktop speakers
            that I had at home. I wanted the speakers to be bluetooth so I got a
            bluetooth module to wirelessly recieve audio and play it through the
            speakers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About this time I learned about
            the
            Raspberry Pi. My dad bought one immediately and asked for me to learn
            how to use it for him. I had used linux before, but never that much.
            Once I finally got the Raspberry Pi running, I put it in my backpack to
            use at school for assignments and other things. I got a portable screen
            and a wireless keyboard. About this time I also made my homework
            webpage. It is just a list of my homework assignments. Then, at school,
            to add assignments to the list, I would pull out the wireless keyboard
            and type in the assignment. This would type the assignment into the
            webpage and submit it to the list. This was how I recorded homework
            assignments before I created I.R.I.S.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a
            while without many upgrades, I thought to add an outlet to my backpack.
            Everyone said that I had everything, but I realized that I did not have
            ac power. I found a 12v inverter online and ordered it. In just a few
            days, I was walking around my house with my backpack on and carrying a
            lamp that it was powering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then came the idea
            that I am most well known for in my school. I was sitting in psycology,
            junior year, wondering what else I could add to my backpack. I was
            thinking of decorative lights, but I couldn't think of exactly what I
            wanted. Then, suddenly, the idea hit me. Turn signals! As soon as I got
            home, I got to work researching. My dad provided me a microchip
            PIC18f4685 demo board and introduced me to the programming language C.
            I had a prototype set up in 3 days and was interested to see the amazed
            looks on everyones faces. I had technical issues with that demo board
            so he provided me the circut board that the buisness where he works
            produces. I made a few modifications to the hardware and reprogrammed
            it. mounted lights on the back and switches to the front straps.
            Version one was completed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the
            summer of 2016, I gained more experience with PIC microcontrollers and
            the language of C while working for Electrimotion. Electrimotion
            produces a device that contains a PIC microchip, a screen, keypad, and
            many inputs and outputs. So, I immediately wanted to use it for my
            backpack. So, that summer, I took that device and modified it to be my
            new backpack controller. Now, with this new screen and keypad, I was
            capable of changing settings about the turn signals and control power
            to the outlet. I was also able to read voltage, temperature, and the
            ammount of current being drawn from my backpack battery and how many
            mAh have been drawn from the battery since the last charge.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Now, I walk around school with all the technical supplies I
            need&nbsp;including a multi-meter and screw drivers, any time
            people
            need power, they come to me, and I travel the school signaling my turns
            to make the hallways a better and safer place.</p>
