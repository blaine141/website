        <h1>IRIS</h1>
        <h3>December 2014 - February 2016</h3>
        <p> In middle school, I did not have a smart phone. I had what I liked to call a "dumb" phone. 
            Buying a new phone was too simple of a solution. Instead, I had a better idea.
            I already knew that it was possible to text an email address, I just put the pieces together 
            and realized I could have something monitor that email address. The idea was to text an email 
            and have a service respond to the commands in the emails. It was effectively like Apple's SIRI.
        </p>
        <p>
            The service, named IRIS, is a Visual Basic program
            that monitors a Gmail account using
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.limilabs.com/mail">mail.dll</a>. IRIS then runs it through a list of commands to
            find what I am
            asking, then responds with an appropriate response.</p>
        <p> Examples of these commands are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are my grades?</li>
            <li>What is the weather?</li>
            <li>What homework do I have?</li>
            <li>What does barbarous mean?</li>
            <li>Is Ollie's open? (Ollie's is an Ice Cream Shop)</li>
            <li>Turn on my lamp.</li>
            <li>Google the pledge of allegiance</li>
            <li>What is pi?</li>
            <li>Tell me a joke.</li>
            <li>Start a game of ZORK.</li>
            <li>Turn on the thermostat.</li>
            <li>(5/7)^2/3+19/14</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br>
             IRIS also has the
            ability to notify me when these events happen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I receive an e-mail.</li>
            <li>My GPA changes.</li>
            <li>Someone turns on my lamp.</li>
            <li>I have homework due today.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If someone sends a message that is not in the command list, it goes to
            a chat robot to create a response that makes sense conversationally. For
            example, If you ask it what it's favorite color is, the chatbot may 
            respond blue. Some of my friends would talk to it for hours.</p>
