        <h1>PWM Generator</h1>
        <h3> - February 2017</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My robotics
                instructor asked me to make a PWM generator with a screen on it showing
                it's current setting to controll variable speed motor controllers. I
                started development by looking at PWM protocol. It passes data based on
                the width of a pulse. In the case of the motor controllers we use, a
                1ms pulse is full speed negative and it is a linear relationship to a
                2ms pulse being full speed forward with a 1.5ms pulse being stopped.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The microcontroller I used did not have enough outputs to control two
                digits of 7-segment displays so my dad tought me a little trick. You
                put power on the positive leds for each segment and tie it to the leds
                on the other digit. Then you output power to make the digit you want
                and ground the digit you want to display. You just then quickly pulse
                between digits.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                My instructor wanted me to work with other people on the project so I
                had a kid 3d print a case for the device. Once we had cases made, I
                worked with about 5 other kids in an assembly line format to make more
                while teaching them how it all works.&nbsp;</p>
